Some of my personal career goals in the future is to be and architect when I grow up and study and Stanford. I plan to working hard in school to keep my grades up and be part of as many school activities and events. I also plan to do extracurriculars in order to learn more about architectural design so I can be more educated about what I want to pursue in the future.  </p>

            <h3 style="float:right;">I really love to do art and I think I am really good at it. I started doing art when I was around 4 years old and as I grew up I soon realized this liking and the talent I had. Soon after, I decided to show my art to the world. I started making posters and drawings to enter in contests. I actually won some contests which also led me to winning district, city, and state awards as well! Unfortunately, not nationals. I think this shows the talent I have in art and my interest in designing. This is also why I want to be an architect. </h3>
