Some of my personal career goals in the future is to be and architect when I grow up and study and Stanford. I plan to working hard in school to keep my grades up and be part of as many school activities and events. I also plan to do extracurriculars in order to learn more about architectural design so I can be more educated about what I want to pursue in the future.  </p>

I started doing art when I was around 4 years old and as I grew up I soon realized this liking and the talent I had. Soon after, I decided to show my art to the world. I started making posters and drawings to enter in contests. I actually won some contests which also led me to winning district, city, and state awards as well! Unfortunately, not nationals. I think this shows the talent I have in art and my interest in designing. This is also why I want to be an architect. </p>

I have learned that if I have a lot of motivation for something in my life, I will work my hardest to be the best that I can in it. And I also go by the quote, "when there's a will, there's a way". I have learned from myself that I can do more than I expected. </p>
